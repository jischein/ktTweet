 i hated that, even my girl laughed and i just gave her a stone face
so.. how about that bandz track
illegal links are
they jealous af tbh. i like some projects from them, but bones is the only one who deserves the sold out shows.
gareth confirmed minilla will be in the sequel.
ayo where can i find some dope flutes? like the one on yg - "left, right" song.
all yall 
he would not improve any of the pl top 4 sides. he would not start for any of the pl top 4 sides. calm down. you are being patriotic and thats good. but the fact is vela just doesn't have the quality to compete at the highest level. scores a few goals a season and thats it. he's not smart enough to play at the highest level. doesn't create enough chances, looses possession too much. 
don't ever quote me again, you ktt niggas are annoying and hive minded as 
stop trying so hard lmfao
taylor swifttttt
							
							
he got 12 assist last season lol
yeah 
what you know about bilal?
"for real this feels like the night when obama announced we got bin laden."
kanye should really capitalize on this whole scenario and just tweet a pic of the 
thanks man, so far i just installed all the 6 disks again and no updates so far if you can gimme some advice or instructions what to do it would be great, my main problem was just getting a response code as omnisphere opened up fine in fl

this is a w for the entire black community
the commentary
"i've read about it and i'm not going to hide the fact that we are interested in him, but i read that it was all wrapped up and i cannot confirm that," rummenigge told reporters.
lorde is too good to side with taylor
yeah and almost got eliminated by liga mx mexico if it wasn't for a dive 
guys get the 
the extraction scene where they jumped out of the plane etc felt like a short film fuuuuuuck
so u ever fix that sample tempo?
in melbourne you're basically playing through seagulls.
lets get this up to 900 by tonight
the simple fact there is very little godzilla and the reliance of dialogue and suspense in a blockbuster monster movie definitely doesnt make it generic (it does have its generic moments though, which really just seemed very spielbergian)
spam/trolling/copy-pasta = ban
needed a dj drama esque tag but 
they have hired byron scott, mike d'antoni and mike woodson, what do you expect?
o i c
 she references the line at one point tho when shes saying "yeah itll be like it yeah she does it made her famous, its more provocative to say might still have sex"

the cops? that happened earlier today, one of my people called me about it. thought the guy i quoted was talking about something actively happening

exclusive picture of nebu and i at the ktt music awards '16:
godzilla subreddit, amc has it as 2:15 minutes, guy called the theatre to confirm, dude who worked their told him its 2 hours and 3 minutes

i think he would struggle to come out and claim balls. de gea has an extra 3 inches on him and he still has problems some times. 
which one?
not really
so i sold this kid a beat (tracked out) and for some reason he can't figure out how to use it that way in logic lol.
the schmoes also saw it tonight but haven't said anything about it 
i loved the soundtrack for this movie
highkey thinking your avy is the owl pharaoh artwork
							
							
white bruh.. 
doesn't matter either way. it's all in the game.  
the family relationships in godzilla films are always the best.

im comin up boy  #justwaitonit
 shes saying 'yea it made her famous' in response to her owing him sex
hey but the difference is she didn't mention names, we shouldn't make assumptions
felt that way before, but instead of 1 year put 4 months 
taylor just another white 
 but didn't she say @ the grammy's "ppl will try to take credit for your fame/success"?
so in one scene near the start the phone rings about joe being in jail. when it ring i whispered to my gf "it's godzilla" and it apparently was the funniest thing the people around me ever heard...

yeah he deleted a tweet that mentioend an email from kanye and  owl pharaoh #2013
i didn't do any of that i think
yeah i know but i meant that in the end he got that balkan dna. didnt the swedish people hate ibra though early in his career, i thought he mentioned that in his book but i kinda forgot what exactly hallend?
the public needs to know about this 
...well, he could at least change the text. that's really what's irking tf outta me
 100% serious tho
							
							
spurs signing toby was really good wasn't it

somebody with reddit clout or twitter connects needs to post this 
do you know what's funny?
it's obvious its not the whole video i hope kim releases more of it today or soon

di maria bought overpriced but sold underpriced. rafael, nani, de gea underpriced. and you're buying otamendi way overpriced 
still the wrong hashtag
who would sit on the bench for vela in our current team? he'd lowkey struggle to start for liverpool
							
							
new avy in celebration?
man said di maria to get 14 assists and 7 goals. fourteen. 
cover is flames, especially if you've watched berserk in its entirety.
he really gave kim and ye the donkey of the day. like he's such a hater ass nigga
no she's not lmaooooooo
well denzel is denzel
someone needs to edit the gif of the sept of baelor but with taylors face on margery

you know what... fine. since i can't stand taylor... 
they said there was no call
saw the trailer in the theatre. whew! 
even just blaze said dont believe the 
looks like the original (godzilla 2000 didn't resemble the original godzilla imo)
							
							
when you hear it...
i can barely ever get on the computer anymore but let it be known, im top 10 travis stans doa
taylors camp still tried to deny any phone call happened, and now that it's released taylor is trying to make herself a victim yet again in another way. she would have found a way even if he did say i made that 
back when selena was all about w's 
currently uploading the travi$ and pusha mesh
were you really expecting r? lmfao
think all the mls teams can afford is to give the designated players free concession items. (limit three per game)

how?
u ent 
taylor whole squad getting exposed 
he started 17 of his first 21 games and came on as a sub twice. so he played in 19 of a possible first 21 games for bayern and the article is saying pep doesn't want to play him....
broward county legend

struggling with injury is an exacerbating the cause of him being crap.
dude stop playing this

perhaps i expected too much from the place 
there is its just confusing & idk how the 
ninety-one
why is this thread not sticked?
i believe one fight will be quick... apparently one of monsters( some giant bug) is 
 colombian lol
what about varane? i always thought chelsea would go for him 
i am getting frustrated at how lvg is dealing w/ things srsly. i mean outside of the field precisely.
then what is? 
"they'll ask me about this at the grammies and i'll say that you called me"
i got a macbook pro with 16gb ram, ssd and that 
idc about what you think about robb/purrp, 
if it doesn't come out in 3 days we have to cyberbully him
you cant actually thing he wants 70% possession, 1 shot on target, 1 goal, 1-0 win....
ain't the first time too i think, he was on this 
just watched that bruce jenner speech. 
chile's defense looks tired, messi about to expose them 
in on 500
he said he made her famous, that's offensive as hell to any artist
cole doesnt like that he had to call the warm up a mixtape. could be more of a free album. quite obviously
i think with new cgi, it could work well. not opposed to gigan either, tho.
his wife is really into sampling so probably someone like 9th wonder
yeah, we finally found a balanced starting xi from that game onwards.
taylor swift is the biggest pop star in the world right now and she is literally complaining about being called a 
no motivation to get on rg all week
go easy on char man..... i think he just wants more information that's all. you can't fault him for that. although the story is swinging heavily in kimye's favor... the full phone call would settle it all... which we don't have.
kanye bout to release charged up remix feat. meek mill
he's about to move into a mansion in canada i believe
got deleted. 
fine$t video is classic
>taylor mad at being called a 
she knew about that line. she wouldn't be talking about her 7 million if she didn't know about it.
if it's a choice between making a dumb film about godzilla fighting other monsters, or making the film i've just watched a trailer for, i'd say it's better to make the dumb film about godzilla fighting other monsters. there's nothing that a serious godzilla film can bring to the table for me.

lmfao what
yessir!  
#haramboys
they usually cause problems with their ball retention abilities but nobody tops us for that in the pl atm so i think we will nullify them pretty well and we just need to hit an early goal to seal it
i srsly hop sothey play like 3 games and 2 of them are barca and real 
from the reactions, the biggest criticism so far was that there isn't enough of the big guy
if depay starts against them i expect a utd loss

well everyone knows gwen dies in the comics
pacific rim was really below average
cruel 
he's been on the decline ever since then.
they won't need to buy him in jan because he can sign a pre-contract then and its only a few months of the season. real madrid aren't stupid, they won't do that.


hahahahahahhaha
i finally copped the havoc kit  email me for trade rockettarthur@yahoo.com
lifted underrated as hell
lmfao 
charlamagne defending ye 
terrible news for you. 
he is fighting no monsters
damm! i thought someone could just point me to what kick/808 combo he used to achieve that effect. epic sounds
nah sgp can't top pretty flacko
good move definetly
kim is so real 
the acting was great. not gonna front here, cranston really brought me to tears in one scene. it was powerful. the chemistry between atj and elizabeth olsen was on-point. i bought their plight, even though olsen could've used a bit more screen time, but with every scene she was in, she nailed it. atj wasn't as bad as people are making him out. what the hell. he held his own, and i cared for his character. you'll find this film just excels at the human element. 
wow
where did you hear that?
metro zu look em up they fire
that doesn't really apply in this movie where soldiers showed a heck of a lot of emotion actually, not in the sense of fear or anything but the soldiers were a lot more casual and "normal" than they generally are in movies featuring the military.
i was with you pt until you trotted out the kane 
friendlies*
dude got his artificial leg signed 
not when it's not serving its purpose and producing talent for the national team. look at the amount of players argentina and even brazil produce compared to us, our league is trash because

i'm still trying to figure out how that dog mustered up the inner strength to break free from being tied up to that tree lmao. he would have took the tree with him if he couldn't break free
did we actually got a snippet of bandz ??
not you breh. the selena gomez person 
like there aren't pictures of kim's holes online
							
							
snek needs to accept the l and move on

you can argue that, but arsenal is having a worse one and probably have no reason to be chuckling over there.

taylor probably doing lines rn 
but in that leaked trailer there was a huge dead monster with gashes in it? maybe i was seeing it wrong?
who is this?
yoo im so pissed niggas never come to boston.... im legit considering driving 4 hours to ny to see him with a few of my boys, u guys think its worth it? anyone seen him live?
omgggggggg i hate yall for this question 
if you're not tweeting taylor swift/her fans rn then you're not really #yeezymilitia
damn man, i've been on for so much longer and you're quickly approaching me on posts. slow down fam.
 sure 
kim exposed the snake on national snake day  
was no edit bruh
u don't get it do u
acting like kanye cares 
did you buy it from drumbroker? it looks like nobody received it from them yet.
ive seen this & i got lost as 
travi$ just posted it on his fb page
so how yall rank the 3 projects?
so she's mad that he didn't tell her the second part of the line
watch him drop 40 tracks
i dont get the hate on taylor
lvg is legit an 
that doesn't mean she heard the line
which is why her reps first said she heard it but advised him to change the lyrics because of the misogyny, and the grammy producer said she heard the song in advance, and then her reps released another statement stating he never called for her approval and that he asked her to release the single through her twitter. now she's saying she only cared about the 
edwards directly used jaws and the t. rex from jp as influences for how he wanted to introduce g

no one who lives in chat threads has a poppin social life and that's a fact.

innnnn
this has been said before.....
how she gonna claim "character assassination" when she's made her career on talking 
okay that makes sense, and looking back on the movie everything you said was there.
man that's weird cause most of the sounds i made were made during the hardest times i went through... i have the most inspiration when i'm going through something... anyway don't let this bring you down, must be hard but hey as xvii said, summer is coming. sun always help you when you go through hard times
delph all but confirmed 
animal is like a sort-of-a-sequel to monster tbh
i really just listened to again. i really think its the sample that has me drawn in to think its some god level kick lol. i'm pretty sure i could get the same effect with the headlines kick in 1da's kit 
i hope so. i gotta say, as much as i love olsen, i was massively disappointed in her acting (she, nor her son, had to be in this movie at all, really) as well as johnson's so it certainly doesn't make me excited for avengers 2 next year.
mr. yeezy, you're gonna 
damn i forgot how easy it was in maschine 1. just go to the group tab and select sound midi batch setup. if u want to have each sound on a seperate midi channel choose sounds to midi channel. go to the options in maschines wrapper and set the input port to 0 or whatever u want. then insert a midi out in ur sequencer and set the port to whatever input port u selected in the maschine wrapper settings. then set the channel to 1 - 16 for each sound/pad in maschine. the channel number u select will control the same number pad in maschine. if u want one midi channel to control all the sounds in that group select sounds to midi notes in sound midi batch setup and select ur root note and midi channel. then select the same channel in ur midi out in ur sequencer. that takes care of controlling the sounds in fl. do u need to know how to route it to fl's mixer too?
i wasnt referring to your post. just made it clear to you im better now. you are my inspiration but i think

i think you're trying to dig your way out. arsenal don't need a centre-back, yes if kosc/gabriel rolled an ankle it would be terrible but lets not act like they are the only 2 centre backs. gabriel doesn't even start. we have 4 first team centre backs, which is a common number for teams.

taylor blocked me on ig 
social media sites are to discuss anything. she claims hash tags won't help out, but then says to talk about more important things. they directly contradict each other. i get you like to go against the hive mentality, but selena acted very irrationally and there's no real way to defend her.

 ew really 
his beats are dope. he doesnt have to do much to catch attention. sometime less is more. what imo he is known for is his drums and making his beats almost sound like you are listening live.
she right though. idk why people expect their favorite artists or famous people in general to always speak out on social issues.
t scott a beast bruh 
everything i said is fact 
if you battle you need to make some beat battle sounding beats. dont just make a beat that you think is dope and try to battle with it. it will be a whack battle lol.

well idk then but im sure with all those kits u can get pretty close. drums knock but to me, they arent anything that cant be duplicated... try layering kicks for added effect. i will say i heard boi 1das drum kit it was no where near the quality of the kits on industry kits same wit jake 1s kit, that may b why ur having trouble those drums reuire some finesse and mixing to sound ritr
looking like van gaal wants players if they are dutch or if he has coached them before lol

if that's really your response, it does not sound like you have a legitimate budget.

dont sleep on verrarti, any young player able to hold down his spot on psg and france is respectable
ya
psg is definitely interested in him but that doesn't matter. we have all the leverage here
legit interesting how the poll is so close. 
2 aren't even done (because of the price tag ) and di  maria was sold at proibably is his correct wqorth. just because we overpaid doesn't mean his selling price was low. rafael and nani were very fair. van persie would've been your only arguing point but you diodnt mention him, lol
$500 together. 
kanye is a laughable figure now, you people really think he can walk away from this a winner?
taylor 🐍wift
 wait on it. these niggas love to pull the "it's more about numbers" bull
chances of ya getting in legal trouble for this ?
taylor makes trash music what is she a goat of?
zlatan feels swedish tho, he was born and raised here so... he's swedish.
pressure's taking robb to that next level. 
tdk dark?  i thought begin a darker 
who is this? will he have a role? or maybe he just had them pretty green eyes (nh), nonetheless want to know more about him
							
							
r u using the right keygen cuz there should be a different one for each update. when i did it u have to install all 6 discs first. then u have to install the first software, source, and patch update. then use the first keygen. then the next update and next keygen and so on.

oh i see, have you read his book though? 
i wonder what ja rule thinks of this situation.
but this 
these little kids have to know that theres more to life then sitting on your computer the whole day stanning a washed up arrogant prick #facts
yea i also think if you end up signing de gea then navas will leave as well
really didn't want this to happen to queen selena 
ould chikh > bakkali
di maria bought overpriced but sold underpriced. rafael, nani, de gea underpriced. and you're buying otamendi way overpriced

who tf in that neogaf thread with me 
in, hope he's in it more than he was in the last one
"yea it made her famous but it's more provocative to say might have sex"
my nigwar
as for st i do think there might be a fit with griezmann, lvg has said he wanted a second striker behind rooney, griezmann had an incredible year last season playing cf and would be a perfect fit. his release clause is 56m pounds though, so don't see it happening this window. also wouldn't look great if he left atletico after one season
							
							
anybody want me to post porn?
woooooowwww they tryna use dead cancer kids to prop up taylor. acting like she did nothing to earn this.
cardiak's specialty is definitely his drums which aren't that hard to reproduce, but hes got good people behind the scenes providing samples etc
anyone know where i can get omnisphere 
i also had a problem with godzilla being neutral towards humans. i just wished they took more of the heisie approach to the reboot.
honestly, at this point i'd be fine with getting a small fee and subsidising his wages for a season as long as he 
"one day, when i was injured and i was with my wife at the camp nou, he went up to her and asked how it was possible to have married someone like me."
pom = spurs
i said he'd be in both. he's not better than average fam.
idk what he did was pretty dop
25 million for schneiderlin is not some fantastic deal lmao. 
i agree. terrible lead.
imagine not remembering mjay.
people gonnna start deleting
what the 
so why did they want replace him in the first place? it's clear he isn't a world class player. and that's what we need to get with di maria's big fee....a world class winger or attacking midfielder
when i use plugins i have an optiion of mono or stereo. some plugins say mono (x16) or even stereo (x16) meaning 16 instances of mono or stereo aux tracks that connect to the plugin so that each sound has its own mixer channel. when opening  kontakt i have the option of 16 so i would just do that. i normally just open another instance of kontakt though. anyways what im saying is that maybe theres an option like that in fl? 
i respect this. soulo is dope too but... favorite rapper???

i wanted more godzilla, seeing godzilla 4x for a few second was just a tease to us audience untill the big fight. heck even the monsters were shown more. but to be honest i can't think of a scene i would like to  cut out. maybe the olsen scenes, but still she's in it for 3-5 scene.

taylor in shambles 
poor kanye, nice try shifting the victim card here when taylor already explained everything and ended it on her instagram earlier. kim lost i feel bad for kanye getting used by her in all of this though.
praying for banks or buck to do it 
why are juve signing so many strikers?

i don't have any of the installation files nemore. i've got ver.1.5.8 and everything runs fine. i never had a single issue installing. honestly it was easy as hell when i did it. lemme see what i can find.

blind isn't as 
jeeze thats crazy  
think father gave robb this entire beat then the other guys flipped it or he just recycled the melody for up still?
or it could be terrifying as 
he left ktt and changed his name after he talked mad 
what's the best way to make these high frequency drums(crashes/cymbals) sound clean, not harsh? cutting some of the highest frequencies?

this is still my favorite thought piece on godzilla and it might change some peoples minds on the film
ask him if he raised the savage, i bet he say "it wasn't me"
i came. 
it is dark lol look at the trailer...the tone...the music
ep is september 
 oh that's what i thought, but it also made it look like she was famous even before tlop
taz taylor is taz taylor
david strathairn is joining the godzilla reboot cast
but it's not the truth, just because a player isn't being lauded as the next ronaldo doesn't mean no one knows them. 
ok now if we were to focus on that then yeah. but they aren't focusing on that. they are focusing on the line... and the 
year of the savage was garbage and tha city was okay. what happened to the robb banks from calendars mayne?
no he's been underwhelming because he's not as good as people thought he was. same as the likes of hamsik, illaramendi and llorente. 
calebluke's exposal is more interesting than this silly beef tbh
sigh. matic plays for chelsea; the most organized team in the league. they are too strong and will be winning the title once again if citeh dont overhaul their squad. on the other hand, blind plays for a pragmatic manager whose mission was to get top 4 by any means necessary. which means, blind is bound to get into a lot more mess than someone like matic would get into. this leads us to understanding blinds role in van gaals team. he started as a dm most of the games and occasionally at lb. the reason and please pay attention to this, why he has high numbers in your beloved squakwa chart (average per game) is because his positional awareness is really bad. this is why he gets higher numbers simply because he has a lot more to do than the likes of matic and carrick. for your 
schweini - schneidi
 pls no mothra, it sounds cool but it would be so boring

he'll play lb

dt. you hear more of the stereo field which is better. its like this, get more expensive headphones when you don't have monitors/don't have good ones and get cheaper headphones when you have great monitors.. that is if you are on a budget which most of us are. if you aren't on a budget get the best everything lol
need a drink?
it still is represented as that. 3 monsters still destroyed a whole bunch of 
robbs album is gonna be a classic
aaaaaaaaaaand career in shambles
it is though.
there ya go
pretty sure we didn't lose 3 of our best players like you lost rvp, de gea and di maria.. but ok? if you think so.

he records the full process of making an album for all his albums u idiot
ye keeps us updated tho. travis announced that he's announcing the release date which is coming soon...who does that?
if it was a brand new note, the back button would have said "<notes", but it says "<search", meaning she didn't type out a brand new note, she searched through her existing ones
400 like the romans  
put an iron in there too
i tried both vmware fusion and parallels. in one of those there was a setting to choose your sound card. if its not in vmware fusion then im sorry. i meant parallels.

ehhhh
it'd need to have sex and nudity.
if they make a sequel they should bring back king ghidora tho 
if this was just kanye fans, twitter wouldn't be like it is right now. this is everyone. the fact that maybe the most famous celebrity on the planet is at the forefront (kim) helps it even more.

is there a link to this?
where did that say it can or should take anything away from the film? what i'm saying that the people who bought their ticket thinking they're gonna see an action packed summer movie aren't rly wrong for doing so. they should still watch the film with an open mind and accept it for what it is but their expectations aren't unreasonable. 
the movement is part of van gaals system.

"i feel like me and taylor might still have sex" is a worse line than " i made that 
yea i think feyenoord will be the biggest threat for psv since they just got elia, will get another defender and dont have european duties.
drop one one time for me 
might wait a bit before more transfers happen before making mine
you need good speakers/monitors like prodlem said or good headphones. i can listen on my crappy monitors and hear the difference, but thats because my ears are trained. i may not have th nest ears, but i can hear things out of experience.

chloe responded and so did ruby rose and made khloe pretty and bad
the mutos and other monsters came about millions of years ago when most of the earth was covered in nuclear radiation(which is actually true. earth was mostly nuclear radiation millions of years ago). as time went on and the earth started to become more inhabitable for humans the creatures that were left reverted to the bottom of the earth to feed off the radiation from the earths core(which is what godzilla feeds off of). when humans started creating their own nuclear plants and creating nuclear weapons the creatures started reappearing(which is why godzilla first appeared around wwii). the mutos eventually made their way to nuclear plants in the beginning of the film. but they we're attracted to our nuclear energy so much that they were destroying humanity to get it
in a 433, who will start?

got a semi at poll results.
ive seen them chop it up on instagram and 
yeah. visually it was. which is why most people went to go see it. it looked dope. but it seemed slow and dragged on at certain parts. and the emotional parts of the film also didn't make me feel any sort of way. pacific rim was a better film to me.
i say 2

why is he perched on the table like that , it looks like studio equipment too
							
							
whaaa, email it to me when you get it. 
when has ye ever been over 1m tweets ?

last godzilla film was like a 7/10 for me
i dont hear her referring to it directly yall are just inferring what she means
nobody knows how many monsters. so far the trailer has only shown one monster. 
posting links are against the rules. thought rules go for everyone
tbh tho, i find it hilarious how ppl tryna tell me not to get my hopes up. i'm the one that been watching him for 2 years and all this time i've been on ktt i've gotten 
what i'm saying is could you afford to enter the same type of negotiations as united? no. let's say koscielny/gabriel went and rolled an ankle, lets not act like otamendi would be a feasible option

lets put the last american godzilla film to rest
 surplus in that what you bring to the side isn't unique or can't be found in other players. besides all i'm saying is lewy isn't anywhere near as important as suarez
what's this?
							
							
but not cuba.
lol spider man 2 trailers basically spoiled the movie 
that synth that was in that father beat was sent over and sampled and reworked by nick leon and zander. fathers melody was the main melody that started the beat so of course he got production credit as he deserved....sorry for telling secrets robb lol
why did u edit that post u little

nah, i just mean on an entertainment level. pacific rim was entertaining as 
dahs right andrew .
what? di maria wants out and he has not been good for us. we will use his transfer to bring in players that will give us depth and even players that will actually start.

he really just 
but his raps are fictional

lucky bastards. hopefully they enjoyed it as much as pacific rim.
old classic or new fresh monster, as long as the movie is dope and has godzilla protecting his territory with dope fights i really don't care. king ghidora isn't the king of monsters
so whats that supposed to mean??
21 grammys 
think he could adjust to the english game though?? we saw how tough it was for de gea
you would probably be supporting liverpool. 
4 people got hurt, not over 20
one theory ive heard is that the mutos invades, so the people decide to awaken godzilla to fight it. however that backfires on them. makes sense with that speech at the end about people who think they can control nature. 
done that five times, i think i figured out what the problem was, my vst search path was still to fl studio 10.  now i've got move all 20 gigs of it.  
they're not even trying lol she obviously agreed to the having sex line as we have video proof of. and the only other line that comes across as misogynistic is i made that 
also this is a misc question but do you know how to setup midi outs to different mixer inserts for 1 instance of a multitimberal vst (kontakt, omni, hypersonic)
says 24/7 is a single from the album (yots) - turns out not to be a single and a song from the 2phoneshawty ep.
for what? 
you are absolutely right my friend, which is why i am so dumbfounded, because gareth edwards said that the theme is what would not make this just a "godzilla movie at the end of the day"
lowkey wished he stayed a supreme/gold grill type of nigga.
me right now with all these taylor stans tears 
woah what the 
why is everybody mad af in this thread rn
oh really did you put money on it? 
first song coming out this month
what if this gets other celebrities to expose something they know about her 
lol nah could be anything knowing 40.. he is an engineer aint no telling what it came from it could be a certain drum sample or a bunch of layers and sound manipulation... overall its 808 style with a medium fast attack and medium decay its not hard to replicate and put ur own spin on... bit it probobly hard to match it 100 percent without knowing what he did idk tho cuz im not really a drake fan so i dont pay attention to his music
got my spoiler in a bit late lmao
#gotosleepselena just started trending and it's 3 ww. 
yeah, i plan on getting the real deal... but with all the expansions it's expensive as f$%#.....
i don't know then homes. did u follow the instructions to the t. u usually have to install all 6 discs first then run the first keygen. then u install the next patch and source update, then the next software update and run the next keygen and so on.
 just chillin with travis. 
							
							
how can a thread be this lit and no one has posted spider porn yet
kylie should tweet her sextape while they at it 
i wish you could read the full synopsis because it was describing kaiju movie of the decade. japan ain't messing around with this
i think he was filming today, not dropping a video today
like 3 weeks so much sampling had to be cleared but maybe later now after all this 
wow 
whos london on da track?
7 games and he saved the team vs spain, plus i could easily find a worse 7 game run by ddg

wtf is wrong with this man 
i have watched him. last wc (6 games) + in eredivisie (3 games iirc bc i was also watching depay and blind). i reckon around 10 games is a good sample size to form my opinion on a goalkeeper?
he should at least release the cover and tracklist tomorrow.... at least...
thread has been blessed.

600 for my butt
you still annoying bruh
the suspense died for me after the muto woke up. after that the attempts at suspense felt weak to me. the middle act was boring af. i loved the spectacle of the third act and the story of the opening act, but in between it just seemed to be monsters on a larger scale, with all of its flaws.
nah b
is this the first ktt exclusive in ktt history
yes, and she also hated the famous video, and i'm wondering what she will say about her friend getting exposed if she's not too busy putting pebbles in her sister's 
so what? the same thing could literally be said for spring breakers, but does that mean it should take away from what the film actually represents?
such an awful, awful coach
i don't really want king kong vs godzilla. i want to see other kaiju get modernized. but i guess that'll do.
crine especially since its at stamford
pg 13 on the website
omar gonzalez shudder
i forgot father did production on this 
 source?
i think it looks incredibly boring and self-important than a film presenting godzilla as a sheer force of terror
did you guys see giggs and lvg reaction after hernandez penalty miss?
goat ktt thread 
all of those players they tried to "replace" him with are better than him and much better than most of our options so i don't see the big deal, he is quality i wouldn't turn him down, idk what build has to do with anything either seeing as he's similiar to mata who prospers here
he has been the most impressive tbh, but i think he will keep number 36 and that looks weak af
scary hours
omnisphere or nexus first. sylenth is dope, but those will take you farther. then get sylenth after,
didn't she even deny that there was a phone call in the first place? like if she really was genuinely mad wouldn't she just have come out right away and said kanye originally reached out to me about the one line but she got pissed off about the other cause she didn't expect that to be part of the song? 
i dont get it
bruh almost 600 pages chill boyz
this is why i can't take people seriously when they say ye isn't relevant anymore
im a die hard g fan, have seen all the films..not since 2000 have i seen him on the big screen, gonna see it multiple times... + i want a sequel

it is the truth, he didnt have any hype. sure some people knew he was, as you said, "people who knew football", but was anyone really talking about him? nah.
well cranston said they were taking a jaws approach with showing the monster
lvg will ruin him like falcao 
i think it was la my man but still 
kanye did not call for approval, but to ask taylor to release his single famous on her twitter account, her publicist told buzzfeed. she declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, i made that

i respect rio for putting a little bit of confidence booster in chicha but no way he is a 25 goals a season striker. he can get you 15 goals at max.
wtf this godzilla looks fake af
how do u know thats what they were discussing? maybe she brought that up and that was what inspired the famous line?
it's so perfect that your name is theory lmfao
this movie has multiple scenes that could become iconic years from now
hopefully this make sense not really sure how to word it.
people itt actually trying to defend taylor
i'm top 5, step your xx up
thats what it sounds to me
yeah man its just some real instruments you cant imitate. thats why i like to sample.
spurs signing toby was really good wasn't it 
do they even beat it ? because i know he was interprated to be an ally by some but a menace by others. don't know what happened to it in the og story.
yaaassssss he is dope as 
really hope chevy gets a new logo that is less of an eyesore
lmfao shwb is jealous? how im dead
"and like my wife said i can't say no" 
 beat him too it, weak ass blogger
put it this way, there's more solid information on string theory than this ep/mixtape/free album. 
dl link?
i would be fine with the first part but not the second, but thats just my opinion 
although i would prolly not start with wilshere carrick and ramsey in midfield
ig we keep de gea obviously he's going to play lmao. yall some retards
this is truly doing the most

oh ok thanks...dont want to spoil it to myself 
imagine if ye dropped can u be right now
yeah it's not a bad look i just don't know how good a yes julz interview would be. idk if she can direct that type of vibe 
or, just maybe...just maybe idk, maybe i didn't have any expectations and i went to watch a movie to see what it was about and i actually didn't like it. maybe i didn't nitpick anything and i watched it without bias at all because i was curious to see what it had to offer from the previews. people always use that tired ass excuse of "having a bad attitude or this person thought it was going to suck before he watched it anyway" bull
johnson is great. it was the gareth's direction. 
 and timbo was one of them, believe me bro it may not have been that high but they were eating way more than the producers today and that's facts.
cardiak uses a lot of sounds that u can find on boi-1da drumkit.. some vybe drums as well.. 
 what you mean email yots?
 papi so 
kanye prob took a shot in the dark with the the phone call thinking she was going to say no either way. he was deff hella surprised when she said yeah its like a compliment 
depends
you've got nothing on napoli. 
i think the next one will include mothra but will also include other monsters
my version of bandz has a jayz verse though
tbh that was my favourite scene 
idk what they could mean 
made 1st quarter freestyle sounding beat 
it's like people go into a movie with a bad attitude and purposely nitpick everything that could be considered a flaw instead actually trying to enjoy it. reading some of the reactions of man of steel you'd think it would have been ghostrider status.

reminds me of kanye production, little bit of seans flow, some of asaps slow-mo sound production, and some of kendricks weirdness. but thats just from listening to two of these songs. sounds real good
lorde still the realest, waiting for her to switch camps
you could leave out the famous line if you understand ye and taylor's past.

it's kinda 
just ran across this on google 
i get what you're saying. even in cloverfield, yeah, people died, but i didn't really feel the weight of their deaths because it was undone by that whole "cool monster movie" vibe. i guess i want this film to really get under my skin, and show the horrific effects of his destruction. play on a psychological level too.
queen swift has only be on the rise.

united come out and say they will only sell ddg for a record fee. august 31st they sell for £20m. 
i'm mean if they're going with the style of the sequels we should have more monster fights imo when we actually got the fight scenes during the end of the movie they still kept focusing on aaron taylor johnson which had me screaming internally 
someone link the taylor stan forum 
you don't understand my argument, they are making the same hollywood crap by trying to give us a 'serious' take on an established franchise!
dont be a follower
they better do good if they pick one of my beats lmao
are you counting just the league or the whole season
started wildin on twitter with blm 
1989 is the year of the snake
taylor never okayed the famous line imo so she still somewhat in the right
 what didn't you like?
i can see those complaints. although i'm pretty sure godzilla was 
what if a bunch of people say that it's fantastic after the screening, like asm2, but it winds up to being mediocre at best, like asm2?

huh, i never said anything bad about mexicans
oooooh metacritic
maschine doesn't work on mac?
they tryna find a way to defend her still 
you know when you see a formation and you put the players into the positions? i think lvg likes the players to stick to that too much, there is no movement. without movement the oppositions defence can hold there position and no space is created. that's pretty much what has been happening.

spurs signing toby was really good wasn't it
meh.. not really a fan. 
new vic song is corny. 
yeah i agree. they were both dope in different areas. 
kim is the greatest human to ever walk this earth, put her face on mt. rushmore. she deserves it. 
we can dream 
90% of people in here don't know what went down with ls it gives them a chance to find out, so stfu.

i can see why that bothers her. the sex thing sounds playful and isn't really a bad thing, but the "i made that

not bad, not bad at all 
usain bolt is the coolest man in the world. 
-this one i just found out about, may be a reach..but i thinks its pretty cool if this were a nod to mothras two twin fairies: 
yes!!!! 
she not cool no more
never said it had no spoilers 
got 10 assists and 3 goals in 27 games. 7 of which he was subbed in.  
so then whens it droppin bruh
							
							
kim is 
fantasy premier league is up!
he's not really on their level imo. respect you for being real though.
ferg gon cry
the monster is dark cause of the weather. it's slightly shadowed and what not, and it's at a distance. and there seems to be lightning behind it, hence why it would be dark.
i like the song and production, just not the chorus.
nah the studio didnt get rights for any monsters but godzilla
tell that 
							
							
idk im busy 
will do. i shoulda reviewed the tha city. prolly will anyway. bout to give yots my first listen now.
what is it
we've done been waitin' for domt since april last year
now sesc knows how it feels
what purpose does it serve? 
i love owl pharaoh
stop stop stop stop stop
gerrard mls debut tonight
nope not yet 
 that's what i'm sayin! i'm bored of the epl font lol. i do want a depay 7. now the question is long sleeve or not

top 3 excuses by rappers:
oh ho ho ho
idk, you constantly want a certain team to score, or a certain player to score, a certain result to happen... 
its trash son
also, pom how much do u think kane is worth rn?
this is what taylor gets for pulling her music off spotify
my brother changed his profile picture on fb to this 
i should be done with the last season when your ban is over, 
i didn't know gwen died which was spoiled by ktt 
thinking about picking this up next week
gonna hit the japs harder than hiroshima tmrw 
it's a whole lot more than just the yots cover. if you read berserk or at least watch the anime you can understand the references he makes to griffith/femto, the band of the hawk, falconia, etc. a bit more. i think robb even said that people should read it before we get to c2 or whatever's next and domt.
wassup with this then? 
no order
if he becomes the new viera 
you're my nigga, but srs, 
the worst thing about this is kanye did it for the art and her publicity and she still tried to stifle a kanye - a black man.
he good
greatest day
i know people who got like 3 beats from sonny digital for like $500.. 
debating on whether i should wake up at 4:30 or just stay up and sleep after the game
cole doesnt like that he had to call the warm up a mixtape. could be more of a free album. quite obviously
							
							
its ironic how the things you hate about di maria like going down easily and attitude, pedro is probably worse in both areas. he goes down extremely easily and is always whining, and he is far less talented than di maria
why does that matter though? she knew about the sex line, she knew about saying he made her famous, she knew the context and she didn't mention being angry about the word 
proceeds to say taylor swift is better than michael jackson get the 
 the way he's playing right now and considering his age, he really wasn't.
is it worth money 
remember when u were defending taylor
still hit serena tbh
 i said sent bhen di alaud salaa phuddi di bucchaa
i wish 
							
							
this whole thing is probably a marketing trick
drums was plain as 
in for 501 
i have like 50 tabs open rn 
i'd like garay but i doubt any of thosr
get your own style 
having a deficit is a good thing
remember back when all white women had to do was accuse a black man of touching her or looking at her and it would get the black man lynched?
lmao everyone knows kane a fraud
how does this 
it looks like emmerch himself just remade his own film
dt is well worth all the money. just save up for them.
mothra was a colorful monster. the monster in the trailer is dark and flies like a plane.  like rodan 
hope wolfsburg hang onto kdb. 
thing is, if we dont sell now and we get another season of it not working out, we will struggle to get our cash back
5 and i have trouble doing anything besides drum patterns lol
 southside is an industry producer, and since he was nominated for a grammy 
same. imagine poisoning your ears with that venom 
hi
read a review that said godzillas only in it for like 15 minutes?
bruh looks like he's using logic tbh
the joys second verse is better than gone's second verse
come to miami university of ohio. white girls with black booty 
chances of ya getting in legal trouble for this ? 
my main gripe with the film is that the human aspect is complete and utter garbage. i knew coming into this film that the humans would be the main focus and that godzilla wouldn't make many appearances. that is all fine, i get that, i get that godzilla was hardly in the 1954 classic, so fair enough. but the human aspect was so underwhelming and not nearly enough to carry the film until the final fight. 
youn can replace the cable if it gets messed up. its custom and not made by audio technica so you are taking a risk. i don't know if it effects sound quality, but it may.
so does everyone else like pom, emraq, memphis & more 
looob
							
							
its not hard to find famo  think about it...theres like 50 or so sounds per xp...hella xp's
that's literally the only part that isn't brought up in the video. she knew that he was gonna say that he made her famous

fetty wap is hot trash tbf
that cool and all but where is the video of kanye telling me he was going to call me 'that 
i always hear about this dude so i just watched the no jumper video, seems like a cool dude.. what's some good stuff to listen to from him?
he looks much older than 17
if artist would just be honest and not be so caught up with trying to keep up an image there would be no image to ruin 
what has suarez got to do with lewi and bayern?
miguel layun is also mexican-lebanese, forgot about that one
i wish i was as 
y
na it does but fl doesn't natively
that roar is 
...
you think the movie was perfect with its run time?
how much do you think soundclick producers charge per beat (exclusive rights)? vs. mixtape-famous producers (southside, metroboomin) , vs. industry producers (mike will) 
watching anything on the new film would be tantamount to reading a movie zine about jaws or reading those early usergroups about jurassic park.
hope a squirrel falls in your bathroom again 
he's trolling. tha city was all nuri & sgp
ktt about to 
owl pharaoh never dropping guys, it's a damn shame
how is him calling her a 
yea
you are an idiot if you think the clips werent cut. kanye said they spoke for an hour. you have no idea what led to taylor saying that. they could have just been talking about the incident again to make sure they were on good terms.
fresh outta debt in this mo 
i would obliterate her 
							
							
how does it?
							
							
well you gotta understand. we hear the sounds and go "lawl" really guys. cuz we know them. but if you a regular fan. you in the club, yall drunk, y'all not thinking bout no chords, no vsts, no presets no nuffin, you don't even know what they are....you just hear a melody you like and that 808 knockin and dem girls dancing. 
if morgan comes spurs now 
anyone know how to get mutv in north america?

 ur so early bro
i just mean in general. that super conservative crap has to be a turn off for anyone younger than 60 years old
need banks on some production from awful 
trap beats are pretty fun when the moods right
look for ethnic sound banks. i don't know any specific ones, but ethnic kits seem to have flutes.
man, what a time to be alive fr 
the 'i made that 
this is it this is itttt
takin all the spots 
woah dere 
that's. because nobody cares about your opinion or taylor wack ass excuse.
i guess but if that's true then why would he have the first line without the second one
y'all really think ould chikh gonna make it at benfica 
also its like a process. try linking his already dropped projects with events that griffith endured. thats all i can say, i dont want to ruin it for yall because its fun seeing yall predictions tbh
he has questions about van gaal. that's why.
powerful
aye?
usa fan going to be eating soon.
real
. thanks for being so cool about it, he says. she replies, i really appreciate it. the heads up is so nicei never would have expected you to tell me about a line in a lyric. and the flowers that you sent me, i instagrammed a picture of them and its the most instagram likes ive ever gotten.
this is nothing to pick sides over tbh they'll probably talk about this over the phone and handle it like that. if they don't 
people say its set up for a sequel perfectly 
learn basic 
it upsets me that harambe couldn't be alive to see the video evidence
my avy aint travi$...
#300
so then whens it droppin bruh
idk, tbh
travis is a liar not stopping until the world knows
rt
no rooftops 2, 2 weeks from today
43 million pounds
he's what you need to not get pushed around yet you've been pushed around the most since he arrived lmfao. 
but tbh if he wants playing time he will still have to compete at city not as much at united
ewww 
denzel is cool to be fair, memphis is always talking 
do we even know what state the film recording of the phone call was made. 
thoughts on a cloverfield crossover ?
this gif is really 
wow cant wait
kanwe yest
might have to drop another diss record for these losers.
i could be epik, and let mf's see me.. but i love the mystery. 
dammm chloes 
homie if you havent already, download snapchat and add kim and watch the last few snapchats. people have been quoting it itt....taylor's comments towards the end really sound like kanye told her the "i made that 
owl pharaoh been getting pushed back for about a year now thats how 
he's good i'll admit it. but let's see, he has declined since 2011 not to mention he is 28, barca have brought in sanchez, fabregas, neymar, and played them on the wings in an effort to replace him, they even played iniesta on the wing if i remember correctly ffs. if he is class why have they constantly tried to displace him from the first team (and spend ridiculous amounts of money in doing so). he is 5'5 and 130 pounds, yeah matches up well in the prem, i can see him standing up to ivanovic. idk, yeah what's not to like about pedro
everybody on twitter being on ye's side instead of taylor's 
just saw this, wow, she 
then pirate fl studio.
zaaaayn 
 i dont get it...
 same but what she say
bars
							
							
no it's good to talk about it and see what we can try and figure out 
thanks bro, i'll look 4 that. even though i believe that it must be on some nexus expansion, that's all mustard uses lol 
lol idk where to ask this. maybe life and advice sxn
							
							
we need context for the things that were said. some things during the videos barely make sense. they should release the full thing.
di maria wants out? the sources stating this are french media. he has said several times in countless interviews that he wants to prove his worth at united to english media
 my nigga, my favorite pair of af1's i own.
yeah i've watch that interview like 15 times lol. i tried to study his game. his deep engineering background helps him alot. homie was ment to track for life not make beats. then he picked up beats for so far gone and he became god level 
rip, i won't be attending your funeral.
was a good album tbf and i hate wale as a person
 i would think the sex line is worse than being called a 
why do you go out of your way to defend every single celebrity that takes an l fam? 
okay its cool bruh hahah take your time. ill 
lol no man, i was just saying cause a friend showed me a pic  yesterday and i use logic too..
if yall dont like my movie, go back to watching transformers 
lol we beef with napoli heavy lol, there's beef even with producers
selena still a baddie
i actually thought cloverfield was terrifying on first watch. probably because that was the first time i saw a found footage/monster film and i saw it in theaters. obviously on repeated watches, i didnt find it scary or anything, just entertaining. but i really like how they weren't afraid to kill any and every character. to this day, that chicks head exploding behind the curtain is insane especially for a pg 13 film. but yeah they were way too focused on not showing the monster and the little monsters ended up being scarier than the final one. 
the only time i am ok w/ pedro coming is if di maria leaves.
whew
u got a budget or nah?
ok cool. i might be the only one,  but im considering getting a darmian kit, guy has been impressing me this preseason.
one more for the full version:
theres a lot of kontakt libraries that have flutes
including you since you called him goat. 
who started this henny thing??? my cousin always says it!
chemical break down of xan and lean on his arm stopped taking xans but still drinking lean like h20 
unless you can confirm it then i would disagree. maybe the original samples came from mathew weiss( i know about him already) but illmind put them through the asr 10 or the akai s20. 
thanks for the reviews. a question: is godzilla mostly an instrument of destruction in this, or does he save the day? if you can give me that info without spoiling too much, that would be awesome.
how big is your covk
lets do it family hmu on the pm
im literally pouring tea all over my computer at that khloe tweet omg
